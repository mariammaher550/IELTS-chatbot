Why does this happen?How does this affect society?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Many countries around the world are becoming richer as they develop and at the same time these countries are seeing a reduction in the size of the family unit. This essay will discuss the reasons for this phenomenon and examine some of the possible effects it will have on society.\n\nOne of the principal reasons for smaller family units is birth control. As a country develops and becomes richer, birth control becomes more readily available. This may be due to a rise in the number of medical clinics or the distribution of free contraception. The result of this is that people can choose family size. Another important factor is the rise in the levels of education that occur as a country develops, which means that women are more educated and more likely to be working. Consequently, many will want to delay having children and so will likely have fewer in the long-term. \n\nThis can impact on society in a number of ways. One positive effect is that the population will fall, which will likely result in less poverty as there will be less competition for scarce resources. The parents can also provide a better education to their children as it will cost less, which will benefit society as a whole. A possible negative impact is that there will be fewer younger people in the workforce in the future, thus making the sustainability of future economic growth less certain.\n\nIn conclusion, family size has fallen due to birth control and education, and this can have positive and negative impacts on society. Regardless of any impacts, this trend is likely to continue as countries around the world develop and become wealthier.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The family size essay is well-organized - the first sentence of the introduction introduces the topic and this is followed by the thesis which clearly states the issues that will be addressed:\n\nEach paragraph then addresses one of these parts in turn.\n\nThe first sentences clearly illustrate the topic of each paragraph:\n\nThe conclusion then repeats the thesis\n\nThe family size essay is well signposted with linking words and phrases to lead the reader through the ideas, giving reasons and results.

Why is this trend occurring?What are the impacts of this development on both family and society?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>In the past, it was a natural step that a couple would get married fairly young, and then start a family. However, this is no longer the case and the delaying of childbirth is becoming very common. This essay will consider the reasons for this trend and the possible effects on families and society. \n\nThe driving force behind this trend is changing employment patterns. As more women have pursued an education and entered the workforce, they tend to marry later and have children later in their life. This is unavoidable in many cases because women cannot combine family and work well due to costly childcare. Another factor is all the other opportunities available to everyone. For example, many men and women choose to travel around the world or take the chance to work in another country, thus delaying settling down.\n\nThere are a number of possible impacts on families and society. Firstly, with regards to families, it can be more difficult for older women to get pregnant and they may experience more health problems, such as a miscarriage, high blood pressure or diabetes, during pregnancy. Also, the parents may find the whole experience of bringing up children more tiring if they are older. In one respect it may be positive for society because if people are choosing to work for longer, a country will have a productive workforce. On the negative side though, in the long-term falling fertility rates will mean an aging population with a lack of young people to work and take care of the elderly. \n\nIn conclusion, there are several reasons that people are having children later in life, and this can have a number of impacts, both positive and negative. Given the fact that society continues to change, this trend is likely to continue well into the future. \n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This essay on  having children later in life would score highly in the IELTS test for the following reasons.\n\nThe Task\n\nThe essay addresses all three parts that are referred to in the question - the reasons and the impacts on families and society. \n\nEvidence and support is provided for all three points, so all parts of the task are fully covered.\n\nCoherency and Cohesion\n\nThe essay is well-organised as each paragraph has a central idea.

Before, such occurrences were limited to just a few places, but now, citizens in many countries experience something similar.

But other times, the search for greener pastures often requires them to work abroad for months or years. Another reason for this shift is societies promotion of independence.

Such independence may also encourage spouses to maintain separate career paths that keep them away from one another for extended periods.\n\nUnfortunately, such a long\u00a0time apart takes its toll on individuals and their families. Homesickness is often a result of time away from the family, leading to depression. If such persons cannot recover quickly, their jobs or studies are often greatly affected, leading to even more\u00a0problems - a vicious cycle.

Children often do not feel their absentee parent's love, causing resentment in some cases. The relationship between spouses is particularly strained, which is why marital affairs and divorce often occur.\n\nTo conclude, because of the general need to provide for the family and achieve personal success, this trend of living apart is slowly becoming the norm.

What are the causes of this? Does it have positive or negatives effects on society?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>There has been a tendency in many countries over recent years for more people of all ages to choose to live alone. This essay will discuss the reasons for this and explain why this can have both advantages and disadvantages for society.\u00a0\n\nOne reason for this trend is economic. People are generally more affluent than in the past, and this means that they can afford to make the choice to live alone, something not always possible in the past. In addition to this, there are also cultural factors. There used to be more pressure to marry young and think about having a family. Now though, people desire self-fulfilment, and will marry later or divorce if their marriage is not happy. Also, the developments in communication technology such as social media mean that people can live alone but still feel connected to others.\n\nI would argue that this development has positive and negative impacts on society. A positive impact is that those individuals who are young and single have helped to revitalise cities around the world, as they are more likely to live in central locations and socialise, spend money and participate in public life than those living with others. However, a drawback is that some people living alone who experience problems may not have an outlet to talk about them. This lack of social support could lead to more mental health problems in the general population, which would need to be dealt with by public health care services.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTo conclude, economic and cultural factors, and changes in communication have resulted in more people living alone, and, although this has benefits to society, there are also negative impacts.\u00a0\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This living alone essay would receive a high IELTS score.\n\nIt is well structured.

Young people seeking opportunities and change are making the move from their rural homes into the big cities with the promise of increased career prospects, greater financial freedom, and a new lifestyle, and these advantages often outweigh the drawbacks.\n\nOne reason for young people leaving is that the business and career opportunities offered in cities is appealing. Rural communities often have limited prospects for young people who dream of more than the relatively simple life of farming and small-town businesses. Regarding study, cities will sometimes have more educational opportunities, with schools and universities perhaps having better resources and advanced technology to learn from. Having grown up in a smaller, rural community for their entire lives, many young people view the move to big cities more as an opportunity to change their social life, rather than their financial future, with the city offering more opportunities for entertainment and to meet people from different walks of life.\n\nHowever, there can be disadvantages of such moves. Unfortunately, in many instances, the promised opportunities do not come to fruition as the markets are highly competitive, and jobs are still limited even in a large city. Sadly the change in values can also be difficult for them to adjust to, and often young people end up in further financial trouble and ultimately have to go back to their rural homes. In some cases, they are unable to create the life they dreamed of and sometimes live more difficult, more isolated lives in the big city while chasing their dreams.\n\nWhile there are potential pitfalls of migrating for these young people, overall the benefits that can be gained from taking the risk in terms of a better future outweigh these. Ultimately it is up to each person carefully to weigh up which is the best option for them before making any decision.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This rural to urban migration essay addresses the task well as the body paragraphs give sufficient details to explain the reasons for moving and the pros and cons of this.\u00a0\n\nIt means the essay stretches to 326 words - you should reduce the ideas in the body paragraphs to perhaps two in each if you are a weaker writer and you are unable to write an essay this long.

One possible solution to this problem is to impose heavy taxes on car drivers and use this money to make public transport better. This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a measure.\n\nOne of the first benefits of such a measure is that the heavy taxes would discourage car owners from using their cars because it would become very expensive to drive. This would mean that they would begin to make use of public transport instead, thus reducing traffic problems and pollution as well. Another benefit would be that much more use would be made of public transport if it was improved. It is often the case that public transport in cities is very poor. For example, we often see old buses and trains that people would rather not use. High taxes would generate enough money to make the necessary changes.\n\nNevertheless, there are drawbacks to such a solution. First and foremost, this would be a heavy burden on the car drivers. At present, taxes are already high for a lot of people, and so further taxes would only mean less money at the end of the month for most people who may have no choice but to drive every day. In addition, this type of tax would likely be set at a fixed amount. This would mean that it would hit those with less money harder, whilst the rich could likely afford it. It is therefore not a fair tax.\n\nTo conclude, this solution is worth considering to improve the current situation, but there are advantages and disadvantages of introducing such a policy.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The topic is clearly stated in the general statement of the introduction, and the thesis tells the reader that advantages and disadvantages will be discussed.\n\nThe traffic problems essay is organised well, with the advantages of such a solution in the first body paragraph and the disadvantages in the next.\n\nEach paragraph has two ideas and they are well signaled and supported.\n\nThere are some good uses of tenses to show the writer is discussing the unreal future i.e. something that has not happened (would discourage car owners..., would be a heavy burden...,).\n\n\n <Score>8.5</Score>."}

What are the positive  and negative impacts of playing computer games and what can be done to minimize the bad  effects?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Access to computers has increased significantly over recent decades, and the number of children playing games on computers has increased too. This essay will consider the positive and negative impacts of this and discuss ways to avoid the potential negative effects.\n\nWith regards to the positive effects, playing computer games can develop children's cognitive skills. Many popular games require abstract and high level thinking skills in order to win, skills that may not be taught at school. For example, children need to follow instructions, solve complex problems and use logic in many of the games that are currently popular. Such experience will be beneficial to a child's progression into an adult.\n\nHowever, concerns have been raised about the prolific use of computer games by children, much of this related to the violence they contain. The problem is that in many of the games children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again.\u00a0For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill, kick, stab and shoot. This may lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts, and behaviours.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn order to minimize these negative impacts, parents need to take certain steps. Firstly, some video games are rated according to their content, so parents must check this and ensure their children are not allowed to have access to games that are unsuitable. Parents can also set limits on the length of time games are played. Finally, parents should also take an active interest in the games their children are playing so they can find out how they feel about what they are observing.\u00a0\n\nTo sum up, there are benefits of computer games, but there are disadvantages too. However, if parents take adequate precautions, the severity of these negative impacts can be avoided.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This computer games essay is  well-organized and it directly answers the question, with each paragraph addressing one of the tasks.\n\nNote how the topic sentences match the tasks (which have been taken from the prompt):\n\nWith regards to the positive effects, playing computers games can develop children's cognitive skills.\n\nHowever, concerns have been raised about the prolific use of computer games by children, much of this related to the violence they contain. \n\nIn order to minimize these negative impacts, parents need to take certain steps. \n\nThis is why  analyzing the question is so important.

I view this as a positive development.\u00a0\n\nThere are certain reasons that an employer may feel this is not a step in the right direction. The main one is that they may feel they need to know a person's age because the job is not suitable for an older person. This, for example, could be because they think there is a need to be very physically fit, such as work within the construction industry where heavy lifting is needed or other work where someone is expected to be very active all day.\n\nHowever, as a general rule it is better if rejection on the basis of age is not permitted. Although some jobs do need younger people, many employers will simply reject a candidate unfairly. For instance, they may simply be concerned about the image of the company and think a younger person will fit the face of the company better even though an older person may be just as capable of carrying out the role.\u00a0\n\nAnother reason is that older people have things to offer employers that younger people may not be able to. If it is a job within a particular field, such as law or accountancy, then the older person will have many skills in this area through working in it for so long. In addition to this, they will also bring a wealth of life experiences that a younger person may not have, which is also beneficial to any role.\u00a0\n\nAll in all, it is therefore a positive development if employers cannot reject someone because of their age. Hopefully more countries will adopt this rule so older people have equal opportunities everywhere.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: As the writer thinks that overall it's positive, you do not want to have two paragraphs with negative reasons and one with positive.

Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>These days it is common to observe children spending significant amounts of time on electronic devices such as computers and tablets. In my opinion, the drawbacks of allowing children to do this outweigh any advantages.\u00a0\n\nThe benefit of this development is that it will keep children occupied. There is no doubt that raising children and taking care of them can be stressful at times for parents so allowing them to play on a device means that the parents can have a break and not have to continuously entertain them. This could potentially mean improved family relationships.\n\nHowever, there are several disadvantages. Firstly, children's free time can be better utilised with other activities. Although they may learn some technological skills, they mostly just play games, and in any case computer skills are now taught in school. Of much more benefit is encouraging children to spend their free time interacting with other children, playing with normal toys, and playing other games outside, which will foster their creative, cognitive, and social skills.\n\nIn addition to this there is growing evidence that it can also have negative health impacts. Research reported in the media claims that it can possibly damage the eyes of a child when looking at screens for long periods. Studies also indicate children using these devices may have more difficulty sleeping, something which is crucial for mental development.\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the drawbacks of allowing children to use computers and tablets outweigh the benefits. While it may give parents more time, it could damage their mental and physical development.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The essay would score a highly on all the the four criteria used for marking IELTS essays.\u00a0\n\nTask Response: The essay answers all parts of the question, ideas are relevant and extended appropriately.\n\nCoherence and Cohesion: The essay is well-organised and easy to read at the sentence and paragraph level and makes good use of linking words and connectors.\n\nLexical Resource: There is a wide range of accurate and topic relevant vocabulary and a good understanding of collocations and idioms.\n\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy: There is also a good mix of grammatical structures that are accurate, and a good level of complexity in the grammar.\u00a0\n\n\n <Score>9.0</Score>."}

On balance, I would argue that this has more negative impacts than positive.\u00a0\n\nOne advantage of working from home is the freedom it provides. Home workers can organise their work around their home life as they can stop or start work as they please, and thus if, for example, they have children, they can easily arrange to take them and pick them up from school. They can also undertake any other tasks that they need to do during the day, such as doing the laundry or shopping, and then finish work later. Overall then, employees have more control over their lives.\n\nDespite these positive factors, however, there are a number of\u00a0 disadvantages. The first of these is the fact that those who work at home nearly all the time will not be mixing with colleagues. When people are at work, they are always surrounded by others, but at home, an employee is likely to be alone most the time. This may lead to feelings of loneliness due to a lack of interaction.\u00a0\n\nAnother drawback is the fact that one may have less influence in the company. It is often the case that important decisions arise on the spur of the moment as unexpected issues arise. If an employee is not there, others may have to step in. If this occurs on a regular basis, the employees contribution to the company may decline, meaning a higher probability of getting overlooked for things such as promotion.\u00a0\n\nIn conclusion, although there are positives and negatives related to working from home, there are more negative impacts. Employees should therefore consider carefully whether working from home is the best choice.\u00a0\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This working from home essay would get a high score as it meets the requirements of the task, which is to discuss the pros and cons of working from home and state which there are more of.\n\nIt is also coherent and cohesive, with paragraphing used to good effect and good linking within and between sentences.\u00a0\n\nThere is a good range of lexis (vocabulary) in the essay and it is used accurately with good collocations.\u00a0\n\nThere is also a good mix of complex sentences and structures and again the grammatical accuracy is very good.\n\n\n <Score>7.5</Score>."}

Furthermore, people these days have become dependent on ingredients from other countries and without it people could no longer cook or eat many of their favourite recipes and many restaurants that depend on food exports may go out of business.\n\nOn balance, I therefore believe that the advantages do not outweigh the disadvantages.

One option to meet this demand is to find it in otherwise untouched and remote places, such as the North Pole. However, I believe that doing this is not the right solution.\n\nThere are benefits to such a strategy. This is firstly the fact that people wish to improve their living standards, particularly in developing countries, and fuels such as oil and gas allow this as they enable the heating of homes, the running of cars and planes, and the production of goods. All of these result in higher living standards, and thus we need to keep finding new sources since we will eventually run out.\u00a0\n\nHowever, despite this, there are major problems with exploiting untouched and remote locations. One issue is that we will end up potentially jeopardising what are beautiful landscapes. For instance, an area which countries would like to drill is the Antarctic, home to many glaciers and animals such as polar bears and penguins. Drilling here would harm the habitat, and in particular, any spillages would be disastrous to the environment.\n\nNot only this, due to health issues and global warming we should no longer be seeking to use such forms of energy. It is evident that the use of these fuels on a wide-scale has led to the pollution of many cities and the subsequent poor health of its citizens where car use is so high. Also, carbon dioxide is getting released into the atmosphere, and this may be endangering our very existence. Therefore, we should be aiming to utilise more eco-friendly options such as wind and sun for power and electricity for cars.\n\nTo conclude, although there is an advantage of finding new places to get oil and gas, which is that we can sustain and improve our living standards, the negative impacts outweigh this as we will damage those environments, as well as continue to harm our health and the planet.\u00a0\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This oil and gas essay would get a good score as it clearly answers the question by discussing the pros and cons of seeking alternative sources.\n\nIdeas are provided and supported.

Some argue that peer pressure is important while others feel it has distinct disadvantages.\n\nDo the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Peer pressure is a pervasive phenomenon that significantly influences the behaviours of young individuals. While some argue that it plays a crucial role in positively shaping the lives of the youth, others contend that the disadvantages of peer pressure are very detrimental.\u00a0\n\nPeer pressure, when harnessed positively, can have several advantages. Firstly, it can foster a sense of belonging and camaraderie among individuals within the same age group. Young people often seek acceptance and affirmation from their peers, and this can contribute to their emotional well-being and self-esteem. A further benefit is that positive peer pressure can encourage healthy behaviours, such as exercising or avoiding risky activities. For instance, a teenager might be motivated to quit smoking if their friends promote a smoke-free lifestyle.\n\nHowever, peer pressure can also have distinct disadvantages. The most pressing concern is the potential for negative influences on impressionable minds. Young people may succumb to the pressure of engaging in harmful behaviours, such as substance abuse, criminal activities, or reckless behaviours like driving without a seatbelt, due to peer pressure, which can lead to long-lasting negative consequences and jeopardise their future.\n\nMoreover, excessive pressure from peers can stifle individuality and creativity as young people may conform to the norms of their peer group instead of pursuing their own aspirations and dreams. This conformity may limit their personal growth and hinder their ability to think independently.\n\nIn conclusion, I would argue that peer pressure has more disadvantages as although it can foster a sense of belonging and promote healthy behaviours, it also carries the risk of leading young people astray and stifling their individuality. It is imperative for parents, educators, and society at large to guide young people in making informed choices and navigating the complexities of peer influence.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This peer pressure and young people essay would score highly for IELTS.\n\nRegarding task response, it fully answers the question, discussing both the pros and cons of peer pressure and setting out a clear opinion on the topic - in this case that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

To what extent do you agree with this view?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>The world that we live in today is dominated by advertising. Adverts are on television, on the World Wide Web, in the street and even on our mobile phones. However, many of the strategies used to sell a product or service can be considered immoral or unacceptable.\n\nTo begin with, the fact that we cannot escape from advertising is a significant cause for complaint. Constant images and signs wherever we look can be very intrusive and irritating at times. Take for example advertising on the mobile phone. With the latest technology mobile companies are now able to send advertising messages via SMS to consumers' phones whenever they choose. Although we expect adverts in numerous situations, it now seems that there are very few places we can actually avoid them.\n\nA further aspect of advertising that I would consider unethical is the way that it encourages people to buy products they may not need or cannot afford. Children and young people in particular are influenced by adverts showing the latest toys, clothing or music and this can put enormous pressure on the parents to buy these products.\n\nIn addition, the advertising of tobacco products and alcohol has long been a controversial issue, but cigarette adverts have only recently been banned in many countries. It is quite possible that alcohol adverts encourage excessive consumption and underage drinking, yet restrictions have not been placed on this type of advertising in the same way as smoking.\u00a0\n\nIt is certainly true to say that advertising is an everyday feature of our lives. Therefore, people are constantly being encouraged to buy products or services that might be too expensive, unnecessary or even unhealthy. In conclusion, many aspects of advertising do appear to be morally wrong and are not acceptable in today's society.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This essay for IELTS is well organized as there are five clear paragraphs, each containing ideas that are relevant, well expressed, and related to the topic.\u00a0\n\nFocusing on the language and structures in particular, the essay starts with an appropriate introductory sentence.

However,   at best these methods are   ineffective, and at worst they may be dangerous.To what extent do you agree with this statement?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Alternative medicine is not new. It is accepted that it pre-dates conventional medicine and it is still used by many people all over the world. I am unconvinced that it is dangerous, and feel that both alternative and conventional medicine can be useful.\n\nThere are several reasons why the conventional medical community is often dismissive of alternatives.\u00a0 Firstly, there has been little scientific research into such medicine, so there is a scarcity of evidence to support the claims of their supporters. Furthermore, people often try such treatment because of recommendations from friends, and therefore come to the therapist with a very positive attitude, which may be part of the reason for the cure. Moreover, these therapies are usually only useful for long-term, chronic conditions. Acute medical problems, such as accidental injury, often require more conventional methods.\n\nOn the other hand, there remain strong arguments for the use of alternatives.\u00a0 Despite the lack of scientific proof, there is a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that these therapies work. In addition, far from being dangerous, they often have few or no side effects, so the worst outcome would be no change. One of the strongest arguments for the effectiveness of alternative therapies in the West is that, whilst conventional medicine is available without charge, many people are prepared to pay considerable sums for alternatives. If they were totally unhelpful, it would be surprising if this continued.\n\nI strongly believe that conventional medicine and alternative therapies can and should coexist. They have different strengths, and can both be used effectively to target particular medical problems. The best situation would be for alternative therapies to be used to support and complement conventional medicine.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The writer in this IELTS sample essay introduces the topic in the introductory paragraph\u00a0(Alternative medicine...)\u00a0and puts forward a clear view on the issue\u00a0(I am unconvinced...and feel...).\u00a0\n\nThe essay has a well-balanced argument looking at both sides of the issue.

Governments must invest this money in public services instead.To what extent do you agree with this statement??</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>These days, the government spends a large part of its budget not only on public services, but also the arts. Although I agree that it is important to spend money on public services, I do not think spending additionally on the arts is a waste of money.\n\nThere are several reasons for spending a significant amount of the government budget on public services. First and foremost, public services are the things such as hospitals, roads and schools, and these things determine the quality of life that most of us will have. For example, if the government does not spend enough money on hospitals, the health of our society may decline. Similarly, if not enough money is spent on schools, our children may not be properly educated. Also, it will be the poor in our society that will be affected more if we do not spend enough on these things because they are the ones more dependent on such services.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the arts should be completely neglected. To begin, it is difficult for many arts institutions to generate much profit, so without some help from the government, many theatres and other such places may have to close. Moreover, the arts also have an important impact on our quality of life. Many people get great pleasure in going to see music and theatre performances so it is important that the government assists such institutions so that they can continue to provide entertainment to the public.\n\nTo sum up, there are clear benefits of ensuring a large amount of investment goes into public services as this influences the quality of life for nearly all of us. That said, I do not believe spending money on the arts is a waste of money as this too provides important benefits. \n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The essay gives a clear thesis at the beginning.

The idea horrifies   most people, yet it is no longer mere science fiction. To what extent do you agree with such a procedure? Have you any reservations?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>The cloning of animals has been occurring for a number of years now, and this has now opened up the possibility of cloning humans too. Although there are clear benefits to humankind of cloning to provide spare body parts, I believe it raises a number of worrying ethical issues.\n\nDue to breakthroughs in medical science and improved diets, people are living much longer than in the past. This, though, has brought with it problems. As people age, their organs can fail so they need replacing. If humans were cloned, their organs could then be used to replace those of sick people. It is currently the case that there are often not enough organ donors around to fulfil this need, so cloning humans would overcome the issue as there would then be a ready supply.\n\nHowever, for good reasons, many people view this as a worrying development. Firstly, there are religious arguments against it. It would involve creating other human beings and then eventually killing them in order to use their organs, which it could be argued is murder. This is obviously a sin according to religious texts. Also, dilemmas would arise over what rights these people have, as surely they would be humans just like the rest of us. Furthermore, if we have the ability to clone humans, it has to be questioned where this cloning will end. Is it then acceptable for people to start cloning relatives or family members who have died?\n\nTo conclude, I do not agree with this procedure due to the ethical issues and dilemmas it would create. Cloning animals has been a positive development, but this is where it should end.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The essay is well-organized, with a clear introducion which introduces the topic:\n\nAnd it has a thesis statement that makes it clear exactly how the human cloning essay will be structured and what the candidate's opinion is:\n\nThe first body paragraph discusses the advantages of cloning humans, and then the second body paragraph looks at the problems associated with this.

However, the funding and controlling of this research remain contentious issues. In my opinion, the government should have the predominant responsibility for these.\n\nOne of the first issues is the knowledge that we gain from research. If governments are responsible then they are driven by the need to make advances in knowledge in order to improve people's lives. This is because they are accountable to the public and the research is paid for by taxes. On the other hand, private organizations are driven by profit. This may mean that some research that could be valuable to society may not begin because there is no monetary gain.\n\nAnother issue related to this is the research process. When the funding for research comes from the same organization that is going to gain from a favorable outcome, there is a strong potential for biased results. Taking drugs companies as an example, legislation usually requires rigorous trials for new drugs that can take many years to complete. The companies have large amounts of money invested in such research and the need for positive results is paramount. It is difficult for a scientist to remain impartial in these circumstances. However, if this is controlled and funded by governments, their accountability means that such conflicts of interest are less likely to occur.\n\nOn balance, I would argue that although it is not realistic to remove all opportunities for privately funded research, governments should have the main responsibility for the monitoring and controlling of this. Strong checks and balances need to be in place to ensure future research is ethical and productive.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The essay is well organized. \n\nThe opinion is clearly presented in the introduction and this opinion is then supported in the body paragraphs and summarized again in the conclusion.\n\nThere are topic sentences which state clearly what each paragraph is about:\n\nThe body paragraphs then go on to develop each idea giving reasons and examples.\u00a0\n\nIn the first body paragraph a comparison is made between the government and private sector in terms of\u00a0knowledge.\u00a0In the second a\u00a0comparison is made in terms of the\u00a0research process.\u00a0\n\nThere is no repetition of ideas.\n\nThere is some good use of high level\u00a0vocabulary, phrases and collocations such as:\n\nThere is also a good mix of\u00a0complex sentences\u00a0with examples of adverbial clauses, relative clauses and noun clauses.\n\n\n <Score>8.0</Score>."}

Therefore, smoking should be banned in public places. To what extent do you agree or disagree?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Medical studies have shown that smoking not only leads to health problems for the smoker, but also for people close by. As a result of this, many believe that smoking should not be allowed in public places. Although there are arguments on both sides, I strongly agree that a ban is the most appropriate course of action.\n\nOpponents of such a ban argue against it for several reasons. Firstly, they say that passive smokers make the choice to breathe in other people's smoke by going to places where it is allowed. If they would prefer not to smoke passively, then they do not need to visit places where smoking is permitted. In addition, they believe a ban would possibly drive many bars and pubs out of business as smokers would not go there anymore. They also argue it is a matter of freedom of choice. Smoking is not against the law, so individuals should have the freedom to smoke where they wish.\n\nHowever, there are more convincing arguments in favour of a ban. First and foremost, it has been proven that tobacco consists of carcinogenic compounds which cause serious harm to a person's health, not only the smoker. Anyone around them can develop cancers of the lungs, mouth and throat, and other sites in the body. It is simply not fair to impose this upon another person. It is also the case that people's health is more important than businesses. In any case, pubs and restaurants could adapt to a ban by, for example, allowing smoking areas. \n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that it should be made illegal to smoke in public places. This would improve the health of thousands of people, and that is most definitely a positive development.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This essay is well organized and presented.\n\nThe introduction is clear - note how it follows the ban smoking in public places essay question - it paraphrases the information in order to introduce the topic and the argument.\n\nThe argument against a ban on smoking in public places is presented first.

I do not believe that this is the case.\n\nOne argument in support of younger employees is that older employees could be more set in their ways and potentially against any change. To an extent this may be true, but there are many flexible and intelligent workers over 50, while there are inflexible and narrow-minded younger ones. Attitude towards change is a result not of age but of personality type.\n\nThat said, physical changes occurring with age could mean certain jobs are more suited to a younger person. For instance, psychologists seem to be in agreement that memory declines with age for people not remaining mentally active. In high-tech industries such as computer programming, where it is so important to be able to work with so much information, numbers and calculations, being younger may be an advantage.\n\nHowever, older workers have a wide range of other positive attributes that they can bring to their working environment. Generally, they have more work experience than those who are younger. In addition, as can be seen with the trend of many department stores in the UK to take on older people, they are seen to be more reliable and respectful. These are important in any kind of working environment.\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, there is not the evidence to support employing young people as opposed to those over 50. It would seem that a mix of the best qualities of old and young is preferential in order to ensure the most productive environment evolves.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This employing older people essay would achieve a high band score.\n\nIt fully answers the task by discussing issues around the young and old working and making some comparisons.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Vegetarianism is becoming more and more popular for many people, particularly because of the harm that some people believe meat can cause to the body. However, I strongly believe that it is not necessary for everybody to be a vegetarian.\n\nVegetarians believe that meat is unhealthy because of the diseases it has been connected with. There has been much research to suggest that red meat is particularly bad, for example, and that consumption should be limited to eating it just a few times a week to avoid such things as cancer. Meats can also be high in saturated fats so they have been linked to health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. \n\nHowever, there are strong arguments for eating meat. The first reason is that as humans we are designed to eat meat, which suggests it is not unhealthy, and we have been eating meat for thousands of years. For example, cavemen made hunting implements so that they could kill animals and eat their meat. Secondly, meat is a rich source of protein which helps to build muscles and bones. Vegetarians often have to take supplements to get all the essential vitamins and minerals. Finally, it may be the case that too much meat is harmful, but we can easily limit the amount we have without having to cut it out of our diet completely. \n\nTo sum up, I do not agree that everyone should turn to a vegetarian diet. Although the overconsumption of meat could possibly be unhealthy, a balanced diet of meat and vegetables should result in a healthy body. \n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: You should begin by intoducing the topic.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>People work hard and earn money which ideally they would like to retain for themselves. However, a significant portion of this usually has to be given to the state. In my view, it is right that people pay their fair share of taxes.\u00a0\n\nMoney is everything in today's world. This is because money is used to buy all the necessities such as food, water, and shelter. Money is also used to help a family's children in the form of school fees and other activities. In addition to this, people do not only need money to cater for their necessities, but also for future investments. The more that people have to invest, the more they believe they can accumulate in the long term. As a result, many are reluctant to lose some of their income through the deduction of tax.\u00a0\n\nNevertheless, citizens should be obliged to pay taxes to the government for a number of reasons. They should accept that the taxes they pay help the government offer them the public services all over the country. These public services are things such as the construction of roads, bridges, public hospitals, parks and other public services. The same tax money helps the country's economy to be stable. Through taxes, the government can also pay off its debts. In short, money received through taxes is a way of ensuring that people have comfortable livelihoods.\n\nIn conclusion, even though many people think that they should not pay taxes, that money is useful to the stability of any country. Therefore, people should not avoid paying taxes as it may affect the country's economy and services that it provides.\u00a0\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: Task Response\n\nCoherence and\nCohesion\n\nLexical\nResource\n\nThere is some\ngood use of vocabulary and collocations and spelling and word forms are\ncorrect.\n\n\nGrammatical Range and Accuracy\nThere is good accuracy in the grammar and a good range of sentence structures.\n <Score>8.0</Score>."}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Multinational organisations can be found in most major cities around the world these days. Although working for such a company provides the opportunity to mix with people from a variety of cultural backgrounds, I would argue that this is not necessarily the best way to learn about other cultures. \u00a0\n\nThere is no doubt that for some people, working for a multinational organisation will enhance their understanding of other cultures. The first reason is that in a multinational organisation one can learn about the customs and traditions of other countries through mixing with people from different backgrounds who work in the company or in liaising with colleagues abroad. Exposure to other languages is also likely, something that gives a much greater depth of understanding of a culture. There may also be the chance to relocate to work in another country, which would mean complete immersion in that culture.\n\nHowever, there are a number of reasons that it is not necessarily the best way. Firstly, there is no guarantee that you will be a person who gets such exposure to other cultures as it depends on your position within the company. Not all employees have roles where they regularly mix with other cultures. Also, there are also other excellent ways to achieve such a goal. For example, many people these days travel the world, and this is an opportunity to meet and spend time with people from other countries. It is also possible to do voluntary work with organisations and charities that work in other countries, something that would mean you meet a mix of people rather than just those who work in companies.\u00a0\n\nIn conclusion, despite the potential ways in which working for a multinational company can result in contact with people from other cultures, I believe that it cannot be assumed it is the best way as there are other options to do this.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This multinational company and culture essay would get a good score for the following reasons.\n\nThe question is fully addressed and the essay is clearly organised.

I would argue that electronic sources of news will gradually replace that of the newspaper.\u00a0\n\nNewspapers remain an important source of news for several reasons.\u00a0 The first of these is that the older generation still prefer to read their news this way, which is because they have traditionally bought a newspaper over the years and so do not wish to change or simply do not know how to do so online in some cases. In addition to this a newspaper also comes with other supplements, such as magazines and television guides, and sources of entertainment, such as crosswords. This makes it more attractive for some than going online. \u00a0\n\nHowever, though newspapers may not disappear completely, the Internet is likely to become the more dominant source of news over time. This is primarily because younger people tend to read the news online and prefer not to pay for it, so those reading newspapers, the older generations, will gradually decline. This links in with the second reason, which is that as media companies start to see a drop income from newspapers, printing them will become unprofitable and they will be forced to find ways to make money from news online.\u00a0\n\nIn conclusion, although newspapers remain popular today, they will gradually be replaced by the desire to read the news through electronic sources. This may be a sad loss given their history, but unfortunately it is an unavoidable development.\u00a0\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This\u00a0internet vs newspaper essay would score highly in the test as it meets the four criteria required for a good IELTS band score.\u00a0\n\nIt fully answers the question.

However, I partially agree with this as the advantages and influences on people's lives actually depends on the particular area of technology.\n\nThere is no doubt that some earlier advances in technology have been very influential, such as those related to technology around the home. Devices such as washing machines, fridges and freezers, central heating, microwaves and televisions were invented many years ago, and now nearly every household has all or some of these in their home, making life much easier. Though they have been improved over time, they still carry out much the same purpose as when they were first invented.\u00a0\n\nAnother example is that of medicine. Despite the fact that there have been ground-breaking recent medical developments, such as that connected to research into genes and stem cells, the benefits to the average person are still many years away. The most influential impacts on health have been earlier technological developments of the past, which remain today. These are the ability to treat so many injuries and diseases and carry out organ transplants in hospitals. It is these that have benefits on so many lives and will for decades to come.\u00a0\n\nHowever, if we look at some more recent developments, they have had a much greater influence than in the past. For instance, there is the phone, which was a significant development when invented helping many people. However, although invented many years ago, technological developments over the last few decades have enabled the phone to now be mobile and connected to the internet. This has had incredible impacts on the way people Iive their lives with people using phones for so many everyday activities and for connecting around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, I would argue that although some older technological developments are important, some new ones are too. The impacts on ordinary people's lives therefore depends on the type of technology in question.\u00a0\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This technology development essay would get a high score as it fully answers the question and fully extends and supports the ideas presented.\u00a0\n\nEven though the essay does not specifically choose one side as presented in the technology development essay prompt, it presents a very clear opinion / position directly related to the question, and then supports this in the essay.\u00a0\n\nAlso, earlier and more recent developments are compared and discussed.\u00a0\n\nYou may have noted the length is 356 words.

The result of this is a world with fewer languages. This is a good thing for people everywhere.To\nwhat extent do you agree or disagree?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>There are thousands\u00a0\u00a0of languages in the world today. Some of them are strong languages spoken by many millions of people, while others are spoken by smaller groups of people, sometimes numbering in the hundreds. As languages die, benefits accrue to human society, but also drawbacks. It is certainly not advantageous for everybody everywhere.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, having fewer languages can lead to greater ease in communication. This is because when people share a language, then information and ideas can flow more easily, which is of utmost importance in a globalised world. In addition, there is an economic advantage, or economies of scale, since information can be presented in written form in greater bulk, meaning there is no need for translations, which can be costly. Thus, internationally, the flow of ideas and information is facilitated through the common language.\n\nThere is another side, though. First of all, those who have lost a language have also lost a culture, a way of expressing themselves, and a way of understanding the world and their experience of the world. They will never be able to express themselves fully in their new language. Secondly, the quality of communication in the common language is limited. The reason for this is that people are writing and reading in an acquired language, not the mother tongue. Also, this acquired language may simply be unable to express some of the culturally-bound ideas of the non-native speaker.\n\nIn brief, then, language death is a tragedy. Those whose language dies lose part of their identity, and a way to give expression to their deep thoughts and feelings. For the rest of the world, there is a loss of diversity. Along with the language, a whole culture and way of expressing this culture die. Things of deep human value that could be expressed before are now silenced.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The dying languages essay would get a high band score as it fully answers the question, discussing both sides of the issue (though you can discuss one side).\n\nIt's well organised into paragraphs, and the arguments are logical and easy to follow.\n\nThere are good examples of high level vocabulary and grammar and there are no errors.\u00a0\n\n\n <Score>8.0</Score>."}

There is no reason for people to prevent this from happening.\n\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>It is commonly known that many species have gone extinct throughout history, including the dinosaurs. Some argue that preventing extinction is not necessary, as it is a natural process. However, I believe that humans have a moral obligation to protect endangered species and prevent their extinction. \n\nFirstly,\nhuman activities such as deforestation, overfishing, and pollution have caused\na rapid decline in animal populations, leading many species to be at risk of\nextinction. As a result, humans have a responsibility to conserve the\nenvironment and prevent further harm to wildlife. It is unfair for humans to\ncause the extinction of a species due to their actions, particularly when they\nhave the ability to prevent it.\n\nAnother\nreason is that many species play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of\nthe ecosystem. For example, bees are essential pollinators that are responsible\nfor pollinating 80% of flowering plants, and thus if bees were to become\nextinct, it would have a devastating impact on our food supply and ecosystem.\nSimilarly, the loss of predators can cause a ripple effect, leading to\noverpopulation of other species and causing imbalances in the food chain.\n\nLastly,\npreventing extinction is not only a matter of responsibility but also a matter\nof morality. Species have intrinsic value, and it is not our place to determine\nwhich species should exist and which should not. Humans must respect the\ninherent value of all life forms and do what they can to protect them.\n\nIn\nconclusion, while extinction may be a natural process, it is not a\njustification for humans to sit idly by and watch as countless species go\nextinct. By taking action to conserve the environment, humans can\nensure that future generations can enjoy the same diversity of life that we\nhave today.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This\u00a0extinction of animals essay would achieve a high IELTS band score.\n\nIt's organised well so would score highly for coherence and cohesion.

While some argue that always telling the truth is the most crucial aspect, I believe that the significance of truthfulness should be considered in relation to other factors.\u00a0\n\nUndoubtedly, honesty plays a vital role in fostering trust and building strong connections between people. When individuals are truthful with each other, it establishes a foundation of transparency and integrity. This creates a sense of security and allows for open communication, which is essential for healthy relationships.\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognise that truthfulness is not an absolute concept and must be balanced with other considerations. In certain situations, revealing the complete truth can be harmful or unnecessary. For example, when delivering bad news, such as a terminal illness diagnosis, it is crucial to consider the emotional well-being of the recipient. While honesty should be prioritised, the delivery of information must be done with sensitivity.\n\nFurthermore, maintaining trust in a relationship involves more than just truthfulness. In some cases, withholding the truth may be necessary to protect the well-being of the other person or the relationship itself. If, for instance, someone asks you about a new hairstyle they have, it could be damaging to the relationship to tell them you do not like it, so a white lie may be the best option to avoid hurting them. Thus factors such as respect, empathy, and understanding also contribute significantly.\n\nIn conclusion, while truthfulness is important in relationships, it should be considered in conjunction with other factors. Balancing truthfulness with empathy, sensitivity to the situation, and the overall well-being of the relationship is crucial and promotes healthier and more harmonious relationships.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This\u00a0truthfulness essay would achieve a high IELTS band score.\n\nIt has carefully considered the question and given a clear and coherent response to it.

While some argue that schools should primarily focus on moulding children into responsible citizens and productive workers, others claim that the individual development of students should take precedence.\u00a0\n\nThere is merit in the belief that schools should prioritise instilling qualities that contribute to aspects of citizenship and work. Good education plays a pivotal role in cultivating a sense of civic responsibility, fostering values such as honesty, empathy, and social awareness. Promoting these values is clearly desirable as they could perhaps reduce social issues, such as crime and anti-social behaviour. Moreover, a workforce consisting of diligent and productive individuals drives economic growth and prosperity, again an important benefit for all.\n\nHowever, focusing solely on societal benefits neglects essential aspects of child development. Young children these days appear to be experiencing higher levels of mental health, such as depression and eating disorders, meaning it is critical to do what is necessary to help each child feel confident within themselves and able to cope with the world we live in today. Schools should, therefore, strive to create an environment that encourages self-discovery and personal growth. Furthermore, personal fulfilment leads to happier, more engaged citizens who are more likely to participate actively in society without schools having to specifically set out to achieve this.\n\nIn conclusion, while the goal of schools should indeed involve shaping responsible citizens and productive workers, this objective should not overshadow the significance of individual development. Balancing both aspects ensures that students not only contribute positively to society but also experience personal growth and fulfilment.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This\u00a0role of schools essay would achieve a high IELTS band score.\n\nIt would score well for Task Response as it clearly answers the question and in the case of this essay, considers both sides of the argument.

Others, however, believe there are better alternative ways of reducing crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Crime is a serious and growing problem in most societies. Although many people believe that the best way to tackle this is to place people in prison for longer periods, others are of the opinion that other measures will be more effective.\n\nThere are benefits of giving offenders longer prison sentences. Firstly, spending a long time in prison provides an opportunity for the prison services to rehabilitate a prisoner. For example, someone who has committed a serious offence such as assault will need a long time in prison in order to be sure they can be re-educated not to re-offend. In addition to this, longer prison sentences will act as a deterrent for someone who is thinking of committing a crime. \n\nHowever, some people argue that leaving people in prison for a long time means that they will mix with other criminals and so their character will not improve. One alternative is community service. This gives an offender the opportunity to give something positive back to society, and so it may improve their character. Also, the government could focus its resources on the causes of crime, which would lead to less crime in the future. \n\nIn my opinion, it is important to look at alternative methods. Many countries have lengthy prison sentences, but crime has continued to increase throughout the world, so it is clear that this is not completely effective. That said, long prison sentences should remain for those who commit serious crimes such as assault or murder, as justice for the victim and their family should take priority. \n\nTo conclude, there are good arguments for and against long sentences, so governments must continue to research the various methods of crime reduction to ensure effective policies are in place.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The writer of this essay has produced a well balanced and coherent piece of writing.\n\nThey clearly answer the question. The first body paragraph is dedicated to discussing the merits of long sentences, and the second body looks at alternative methods. Finally, the writer provides their own opinion on the issue.\n\nVery important for IELTS essays, each paragraph has a clear central topic which is expanded upon in the supporting sentences.\n\nRegarding grammar, the writer has successfully demonstrated their ability to use a mix of sentence structures, including a variety of complex sentences (although... someone who... in order to... means that... which would...). \n\nIdeas are coherently presented by using transition words (Firstly,...

To conclude,...).\n\nIt is important in IELTS essays to have good topic related vocabulary in order to achieve a higher score, and this is evident in this piece of work (re-offend... rehabilitate... re-educated... deterrent... committing a crime...).\n\nAlso of importance with regards to vocabulary is to vary your word choices and not to repeat the same word. This can be done by using synonyms, as the writer has done with the word alternative 'ways', using variations of this (methods... measures...).\n\n\n <Score>8.5</Score>."}

Others believe that the family still remains more important. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion.</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>While parents obviously play a major role in the way that their child develops as they get older, many people believe that social factors outside of the family now influence children much more. This essay will examine both sides of the argument. \n\nThere is no doubt that there are factors external to the family that significantly impact on a child's development. \u00a0For example, there is television and the internet. Children these days have access to these much more than they used to in the past, and they will pick up language and see things that will teach them about life. Friends also have an important influence as a child will often copy peers that they admire and respect. This could be positive behaviour but it could also be negative, such as smoking or taking drugs. \n\nUltimately, however, it is family who have the most important impact. Children spend nearly all of their time with their family, especially in their early years. They develop their confidence, socialisation skills, morals, values and views on life through their interaction with them. Proof of the importance of this can be seen in the differences between some children. Those that grow up in a dysfunctional home often eventually have problems themselves, whilst those that are brought up in a warm and close environment end up more confident and secure in adult life.\n\nTo conclude, it is the family that can provide a supportive, secure, and nurturing environment, which is crucial to the way in which a child becomes an adult. Although it is clear that social factors play a part, I would argue that it is the former that is the most important. \n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The child development essay has a good introduction that clearly sets out what the two opposing opinions are (this is done by paraphrasing the question).\n\nThe thesis sentence (last sentence of the introduction) then clearly states what will be in the essay - a discussion of the two opinions.\n\nThe body paragraphs are coherent - each one clearly discusses one of the opinions.

While some people believe governments should be responsible for improving the health of their nation, others believe it is up to the individual. This essay will examine both sides of the argument. \n\nThere is no doubt that individuals must take some responsibility for their diet and health. The argument to support this is the fact that adults have free will and make their own choices about what they eat and the exercise that they do. Children are also becoming less healthy. However, their parents are the ones who provide their evening meals so it is their responsibility to ensure these meals are nutritious and encourage them to avoid junk food and sugary snacks during the day. \n\nDespite these arguments, there is also a case for advocating the intervention of the state. People these days often have little choice but to depend on fast food or ready meals that are high in sugar, salt and fat due to the pressures of work. Governments could regulate the ingredients of such food. Some governments also spend huge amounts of tax money on treating health problems of their citizens in hospitals. It would be logical to spend this on preventative measures such as campaigns to encourage exercise and a good diet. \n\nHaving considered both sides of the issue, I would argue that although individuals must take ultimate responsibility for what they eat, governments also have a role to play as only they can regulate the food supply, which openly encourages a poor diet. It is only through this combination that we can improve people's health. \n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: The IELTS diet and health essay has a number of good points which would means it would score highly in the test. \n\nThe introduction clearly introduces the topic and sets out both sides of the issue.

Other  working parents think that family members such as grandparents will be better  carers for their children.Discuss both views and give your opinion.</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Although it is common for parents these days to\nplace their children that are pre-school age into childcare centres, some\npeople criticise this and argue that children will receive a better level of\ncare from relatives such as grandparents. Personally, I would argue that the\nbest choice is to send children to a childcare centre.\n\n\n\n\nThose that support care through grandparents cite\nseveral reasons for this. Firstly, they claim that this is the safest option\ndue to the fact that they are family members so they can be trusted at all\ntimes to put the health and safety of the child first. Another important\nconsideration is costs. Parents will have to pay to place their children in a\nchildcare centre, and with the financial burdens that families face these days,\nusing relatives to care for children would be a considerable cost saving.\u00a0 \n\nDespite these benefits, there are clear advantages of using professional carers. First and foremost, staff members at most centres are fully trained in early\nchildhood education so they understand child development and will be able to\nnurture the child's growing skills in the best way. Not only this, since there are a mix\nof instructional activities during the day such as painting, singing, and\nstorytelling, children's creativity and learning will be developed. Last\nbut not least, children can benefit from the opportunity to socialize with\nother children, which they might not get to do with a relative caring for them\nat home. \n\nTo conclude, I am of\nthe opinion that the advantages of using childcare facilities to look after\npre-school children clearly outweigh the benefits of using relatives. This is because the environment\nthey are brought up in will result in children who are well-educated,\ncreative and sociable.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This childcare essay would achieve a high IELTS for the following reasons.\u00a0\n\nTask Response\n\nThe question has been fully answered.

Others however prefer to give money to national and international charitable organisations.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Giving money to those in need can be a personally satisfying experience, but there is a choice between donating nationally and internationally through charities or giving directly to those around you. This essay will consider the merits of both approaches.\u00a0\n\nThe first advantage of providing direct support is that you can know exactly how your money is being spent. For example, if you give money directly to people in your local village or town, you can see where it has gone. When you donate to larger charitable organisations, on the other hand, you are not sure how much will actually be given to those in need as opposed going on other costs such as administration and expensive marketing campaigns. Another benefit is that you can see the impacts on those you are helping, which can lead not only to great personal satisfaction but also to respect from others in the local community who appreciate the work you do.\n\nThere are advantages, however, in giving to charities that are national and international. First and foremost there is the choice of good causes. Locally the kinds of places to help may be limited, but in larger organisations you can get involved in such activities as sponsoring a child or conserving wildlife. Not only this, donating to larger charities with an international reach means having the knowledge that you are involved in issues of fundamental global importance, such as curing diseases and human rights, or helping those caught up in tragic environmental events, such as flooding, earthquakes and famines.\u00a0\n\nIn conclusion, given the benefits of both, I would argue that an individual should make their own choice based on their personal preferences and whichever provides them with the most personal satisfaction. What is crucial is that we continue to give to those who are more in need than ourselves.\u00a0\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This donating money to charity essay should achieve a high IELTS score in the test for a number of reasons. \n\nFirstly the introduction opens by letting the reader know what the topic is and the two sides of the argument under consideration. \n\nThis is then followed by a clear thesis statement to clarify what the essay is going to do.\u00a0\n\nCoherence and cohesion are good because it's very easy to read and follow the arguments in each paragraph and to see clearly that each body paragraph has one controlling idea i.e.\n\nTransitional phrases and words are also used well to guide the user through the ideas:\n\nThe conclusion gives the writer's opinion very clearly.\n\nThe essay also has a wide range of grammatical structures and a high level of grammatical accuracy.\u00a0\n\n\n <Score>8.5</Score>."}

Others however believe that zoos can be useful in protecting wild animals. Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.</Task> \n And here is my answer: \n <Answer>Zoos remain popular\nplaces for people to visit for entertainment and to learn about wild animals.\nAlthough some people are of the opinion that zoos can provide a sanctuary for\nendangered animals and\u00a0so should be kept open, I believe that the\ncruelty that animals suffer outweighs this benefit, and that they should be\nshut down.\n\n\n\n\nThese days, animals are under\nthreat from humans in many ways, seen for example in the way that their\nhabitats are being destroyed through the cutting down of rain forests, or\nthrough poaching.\u00a0Following on from this, the argument is that zoos can protect some of these animals that are under threat. The reason is that they are in a safe environment managed by trained staff who can ensure the animals are looked after and can produce offspring. There are examples of successes in this respect, such as with Pandas, which have been endangered for many years but have been protected.\n\nHowever, there are more convincing arguments for why zoos should be shut down. Firstly, even though some species are under threat, there are lots of animals which do not fall into this category and who are there just for the entertainment of visitors. While it may be fun and educational to see them, animals are not meant to be caged, and their distress can often be seen in the way many\u00a0of them\u00a0pace back and forwards all day. Not only this, if the prime reason of zoos is to protect animals, this could be done in other environments such as wild life parks where the animals have more freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, animals should be protected but this does not have to be in zoos. Zoos are cruel to animals, not similar enough\u00a0to their natural habitat, and they should be closed down.\u00a0\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: Band scores are given for task response, coherence and cohesion, lexis (vocabulary) and grammatical range and accuracy.\u00a0\n\nThis zoo essay would get a good score for task response as it fully answers the question by discussing both opinions and giving a personal opinion.

However, in the modern era, some people believe that dependency between people has increased, whereas others believe that people have grown to be more independent.\u00a0\n\nOne reason that people think we are more dependent on each other is because of our reliance on others to provide a positive image of ourselves. People are bombarded these days with pictures of beautiful models and people who seem to have perfect lives. Many people therefore feel the need to go on social media, such as Facebook and Instagram, in order to post pictures and they need others to get as many \u00e2\u0080\u0098likes' as possible. \u00a0In addition to this, because of the hectic and busy lives some families lead, it is argued they are dependent on others to support them, such as with grandparents helping to take care of their grandchildren because the parents don't have time.\u00a0\n\nHowever, despite this, overall I believe that people are generally more independent. This can be seen in the way that so many people live away from their families and lead their own lives. For example, families used to live nearby to each other, but nowadays people often reside in different cities to their parents and siblings or in other countries, seeing each other only rarely in some cases. Not only this, people prefer more privacy than in the past and do not require help from others, seen in the way that neighbours these days often do not know each other or interact at all.\n\nIn conclusion, although in certain ways people are more dependent, it is generally the case that people now live more independent lives. Only over time will it be revealed as to whether this is a positive or negative development for society. \u00a0\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: So that is the best way to answer a question like that.\u00a0\n\nYou must make sure that you clearly discuss each opinion so it's best to just discuss each one within a separate body paragraph.\u00a0\n\nIt is a difficult question but don't spend too long thinking of the best ideas as the key is in the way you present and organise them.\n\n\n <Score>8.0</Score>."}

Personally, I believe that later is better.\u00a0\n\nThose who argue for beginning earlier base this on several reasons. Firstly, they believe that the earlier a child starts to learn, the better their intelligence will be. This is because they will have a head-start over those starting later who will fall behind. Another reason is that children will learn to be competitive, independent, and motivated as they aim to get the best scores and to complete their homework on their own. These are strong arguments in a world which these days rewards the highest achievers with the best jobs.\u00a0\n\nDespite these arguments, I believe starting at age 7 is the right choice. This is due to the fact that over-burdening them with academic study and trying to beat others simply leads to stress. This is not a good situation for the very young, who should be encouraged to enjoy their lives not compete with their peers. Also focusing on play-based programmes at home or elsewhere develops cognitive abilities most effectively. For example, in countries such as Sweden and Finland children start formal education later and they have shown better schooling results than many other countries. Thus, there is clear evidence of its benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that children should start school later because they can learn more through play-based activities than formal education. Formal education at an early age simply leads to stress and does not help children achieve higher grades long-term.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This formal and informal education essay for IELTS would score well as it answers the question, discussing both the opinions, with the writer also giving their own opinion.\n\nIt is a clearly organised essay, with each body paragraph based around one central idea.

Many people consider politicians as those who have much sway over the general direction of society. But there are those who think scientists are the true driving force.\n\nAs the leaders of their respective nations, politicians influence the world by creating laws to govern their people. Such laws affect how their people act, how they live, and possibly even how they think. Furthermore, politicians also influence the nations around them as their actions may help countries or pull them down. That is why many pay attention to the rhetoric and actions of powerful leaders since these affect the policies of the world.\n\nHowever, others believe scientists are more influential. This is primarily because the world is what it is because of what scientists have already created, seen for example in the way that people can circle the globe in less than a day and contact loved ones instantly because of high-tech devices. Another reason is that much of what the world will become depends upon the ongoing work of scientists. Issues like climate change, resource sustainability, and vaccines for pandemics can only be resolved by these scientists. So what they are doing now and what they will continue to do in the future will greatly affect the world.\n\nBetween the two, I believe that politicians have more influence. Although I acknowledge that scientific contributions have truly changed our way of life, politicians are still directly affecting people daily because of their policies. In fact, politicians often influence what scientists research as the government usually has a hand in many key research projects, especially those that may revolutionise how people live. \n\nIn conclusion, even if scientists are working toward solutions, politicians are still the ones directing which problems to solve and who should first benefit from the results. Therefore, the true power is in the politicians' hands.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This influence of scientists and politicians essay for IELTS would score well as it covers both opinions and the writer also gives their opinion.\n\nIt would also score highly as it discusses the issue in-depth, with good support and examples given.\n\nIf you are a weaker candidate you may struggle to write 318 words so you should keep it shorter as quality is more important than quantity.\n\nFor instance, the writers opinions could be shortened and simply included as part of the conclusion. This would be quicker and take fewer words.\u00a0\n\nThe essay also has a range of grammatical structures and is accurate. There is good use and range of vocabulary, some of it topic-related vocabulary.\n\n <Score>8.0</Score>."}

While it may be true that children today have access to more stimulation than ever before, I fear this argument overlooks the many other benefits of story time to both the children and parents.\n\nThe increased availability of a variety of stories through varied platforms gives children of all ages greater access to new and exciting worlds. Where parents would traditionally be able to share one or two stories in a day, a child today can engage with a different story every hour or two. This helps build creativity and grows a child's sense of the world around them. Because of the range of mediums, children learn to interpret and engage with a story through other senses beyond just listening. The improved graphics in TV and movies have opened up whole worlds of characters that come to life in a new and exciting way not previously possible.\n\nHowever, an in-person story allows children to interact with it - asking questions, adding their own creative input and immersing themselves in this new world, with their parents along for the adventure. The interpersonal nature of reading to a child allows them to use their own imagination to create a visual world for the story, an important form of creative expression for growing minds. The aspect of time spent together is also important to a child's development. In a world where children spend time alone with screens for stimulation from a very young age, it's important that they also receive one-on-one time with parents to develop interpersonal skills and meaningful relationships.\u00a0\n\nThere is no denying that access to a wide range of stimulation for children can provide many of the benefits of traditional storytelling such as stimulating concentration, imagination and curiosity., but in my opinion, it is not a replacement for the tradition of telling stories. One-on-one time, interaction and a different form of creative expression are only some of these benefits that would be lost if we left all forms of entertainment up to books, TV or movies.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This \u00a0essay for IELTS would achieve a high score because it answers the question, discussing both the opinions, with the writer also giving their own opinion.\n\nIt is a clearly organised essay, with each body paragraph based around one central idea.

While some people believe that using taxpayer funds to find life on other planets is essential, others see it as a poor use of public money.\n\nThose\nwho believe in the importance of searching for extraterrestrial life argue that\nthis is an opportunity to answer one of the biggest questions in science and\nhuman history: are we alone in the universe? They also believe that such a\nsearch will have tremendous scientific and technological benefits, including\nthe development of new instruments, techniques, and methods of exploration that\ncan be used for other purposes. Moreover, the discovery of extraterrestrial\nlife, even if only in the form of microbial organisms, would have a profound\nimpact on our understanding of the universe and the origin of life itself.\n\nThat\nsaid, I personally hold the view that though such research is important, the\nmoney spent on this should be balanced against other important needs and should\nnot come at the expense of other critical programs. There are many pressing\nissues on our own planet that require funding, such as the major problems of\npoverty, hunger, disease, and environmental degradation. These are all\nurgent issues that affect millions of people around the world. We\nneed to be mindful of the limited resources available to us and make sure that\nthey are used in a responsible and effective manner. \n\nIn\nconclusion, the search for extraterrestrial life is an important and\nfascinating endeavour, but it must be balanced against other critical needs.\nThe investment in this area should be used wisely and effectively, taking into\naccount the benefits and limitations of the research, and should not be to the detriment of other important programs.\n\n</Answer>", "completion": "Feedback: This extraterrestrial life essay would score highly for IELTS as it clearly answers the question, discussing both sides of the issues and providing the writers opinion.\u00a0Ideas have supporting evidence and examples.\u00a0\n\nIt has good coherence and cohesion as it's well-organised into paragraphs and makes use of discourse markers and linking words well.\n\nThere are good examples of lexis and collocations, many of which are topic-related.\n\nThere are also good examples of accurate and effective grammatical forms and sentences.\n\n\n\n\n <Score>9.0</Score>."}
