    "For Task 2 of both AC and GT Writing tests, candidates are required to formulate and\n",
    "develop a position in relation to a given prompt in the form of a question or\n",
    "statement, using a minimum of 250 words. Ideas should be supported by evidence,\n",
    "and examples may be drawn from a candidate’s own experience.\n",
    "The TR criterion assesses:\n",
    "▪ how fully the candidate responds to the task.\n",
    "▪ how adequately the main ideas are extended and supported.\n",
    "▪ how relevant the candidate’s ideas are to the task.\n",

    "the message: how the response organises and links information, ideas and language.\n",
    "Coherence refers to the linking of ideas through logical sequencing, while cohesion\n",
    "refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (e.g. logical connectors,\n",
    "conjunctions and pronouns) to assist in making clear the relationships between and\n",
    "within sentences.\n",
    "The CC criterion assesses:\n",
    "▪ the coherence of the response via the logical organisation of information\n",
    "and/or ideas, or the logical progression of the argument.\n",
    "▪ the appropriate use of paragraphing for topic organisation and presentation.\n",
    "▪ the logical sequencing of ideas and/or information within and across\n",
    "paragraphs.\n",
    "▪ the flexible use of reference and substitution (e.g. definite articles, pronouns).\n",
    "▪ the appropriate use of discourse markers to clearly mark the stages in a\n",
    "response, e.g. [First of all | In conclusion], and to signal the relationship between ideas and/or information, e.g. [as a result | similarly].\n",
    "\n",
    "LEXICAL RESOURCE (LR)\n",
    "This criterion refers to the range of vocabulary the candidate has used and the\n",
    "accuracy and appropriacy of that use in terms of the specific task.\n",
    "The LR criterion assesses:\n",
    "▪ the range of general words used (e.g. the use of synonyms to avoid repetition).\n",
    "▪ the adequacy and appropriacy of the vocabulary (e.g. topic-specific items,\n",
    "indicators of writer’s attitude).\n",
    "▪ the precision of word choice and expression.\n",
