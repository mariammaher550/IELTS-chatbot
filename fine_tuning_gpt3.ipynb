    "statement, using a minimum of 250 words. Ideas should be supported by evidence,\n",
    "and examples may be drawn from a candidate’s own experience.\n",

    "Coherence refers to the linking of ideas through logical sequencing, while cohesion\n",
    "refers to the varied and appropriate use of cohesive devices (e.g. logical connectors,\n",
    "conjunctions and pronouns) to assist in making clear the relationships between and\n",
    "within sentences.\n",
    "The CC criterion assesses:\n",
    "▪ the coherence of the response via the logical organisation of information\n",
    "and/or ideas, or the logical progression of the argument.\n",
    "▪ the appropriate use of paragraphing for topic organisation and presentation.\n",
    "▪ the logical sequencing of ideas and/or information within and across\n",
    "paragraphs.\n",
    "▪ the flexible use of reference and substitution (e.g. definite articles, pronouns).\n",
    "▪ the appropriate use of discourse markers to clearly mark the stages in a\n",

    "▪ the range of general words used (e.g. the use of synonyms to avoid repetition).\n",

Why does this happen?How does this affect society?</Task> \\n And here is my answer: \\n <Answer>Many countries around the world are becoming richer as they develop and at the same time these countries are seeing a reduction in the size of the family unit. This essay will discuss the reasons for this phenomenon and examine some of the possible effects it will have on society.\\n\\nOne of the principal reasons for smaller family units is birth control. As a country develops and becomes richer, birth control becomes more readily available. This may be due to a rise in the number of medical clinics or the distribution of free contraception. The result of this is that people can choose family size. Another important factor is the rise in the levels of education that occur as a country develops, which means that women are more educated and more likely to be working. Consequently, many will want to delay having children and so will likely have fewer in the long-term. \\n\\nThis can impact on society in a number of ways. One positive effect is that the population will fall, which will likely result in less poverty as there will be less competition for scarce resources. The parents can also provide a better education to their children as it will cost less, which will benefit society as a whole. A possible negative impact is that there will be fewer younger people in the workforce in the future, thus making the sustainability of future economic growth less certain.\\n\\nIn conclusion, family size has fallen due to birth control and education, and this can have positive and negative impacts on society. Regardless of any impacts, this trend is likely to continue as countries around the world develop and become wealthier.\\n\\n</Answer>'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Feedback: The family size essay is well-organized - the first sentence of the introduction introduces the topic and this is followed by the thesis which clearly states the issues that will be addressed:\\n\\nEach paragraph then addresses one of these parts in turn.\\n\\nThe first sentences clearly illustrate the topic of each paragraph:\\n\\nThe conclusion then repeats the thesis\\n\\nThe family size essay is well signposted with linking words and phrases to lead the reader through the ideas, giving reasons and results.
